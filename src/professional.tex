      backscatter''. Various data processing and cleansing
      techniques were applied by me and my teammate to process data
      from the acoustic backscatter so that various machine learning algorithms can be applied.
      Used the Simplex method as a convergence test to estimate parameters
      for a mathematical model being verified using experimental data.}
